It contains data about professional baseball (MLB) games played in the 2016 season. There are 2,427 games in the data set. Each row represents a single game. The goal is to predict the attendance at a home team’s game. This is an important task because most franchises want to predict the number of attendees for a variety of reasons including profits."
